Welcome to my blog! Here I will express my thoughts about the projects I work on, reflect on what I read, and my perspective on miscellaneous topics.

Today I wanted to talk about the process I went through to set up this blog. I've been contemplating setting up a blog for some time but always thought of the task as daunting, but upon talking about the possible options with others I decided to not let the intimidation stop me. This reminds me a common advice given about solving progaming problems: "get to a working solution first, and then optimize," so that is what I did, I set up a github.io page and forked a site tempalte [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to use as my base, this is my working solution, but definitely not my optimal. I as I get into the workflow of writing posts and making changes to the site, I will be able to adjust the site to provide a better experience for you.

It is baffling to me how easy it is to get a site up and running now. I just followed the instructions on [the Github pages site](https://pages.github.com) and picked out the theme from [Jekyll's documentation resources](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/) and followed the theme's installation instructions, the only real problem I ran into was having to set up the dependencies for the tempalate, and even there it was just a matter of apt installing a short list of programs. Once I installed the dependencies, all that was left was to return the Jekyll documentation on how to create the individual posts, which was following a straight forward set of steps. With just that I've created a website that can now be seen from anywhere!

Thank you for reading!
